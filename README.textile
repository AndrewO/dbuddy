h1. DBuddy

Have stored procedures or view definitions in your application? Wouldn't it be great if you could keep those with the rest of your code?

DBuddy is a small script that does two things to streamline this process:

# Loads all of the SQL files matching one or more globs
# Watches over those files and reloads them on changes

h2. Usage

Loading:

<pre><code>
  dbuddy db/views/*.sql db/procedures/*.sql
</code></pre>

Watching:

<pre><code>
  dbuddy --watch db/views/*.sql db/procedures/*.sql
  dbuddy -w db/views/*.sql db/procedures/*.sql
</code></pre>

From code (e.g. rake task)

<pre><code>
  DBuddy.run(ActiveRecord::Base.connection, Dir.glob("db/views/*.sql") + Dir.glob("db/procedures/*.sql"))
</code></pre>

h2. TODOs

* Right now it assumes it's being run in the root of a Rails project and loads config/environment.rb. This could be improved, but right now I don't have a use case.
